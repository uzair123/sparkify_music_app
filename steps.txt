Steps:

Load Data


CHECK LIST FOR DATA ANALYSIS:

Analyze Data:
 List all the column names 
 Check for the size of the data frame , which is total entries (total rows in dataframe)
 List of Unique valus for each column category
 Group users by location 
 How many users per location ? easier would be how many users in cities
 How many males / Females? in each location ? 
 which song was most played?
 
 How many users in total for this small data set? 
 Number of users Churned = 
 Number of users stayed = 
 

Clean data - 
  Missing values such as Nan, null 
  Empty Strings
  Duplicates (depends on use case) - This needs to be reviewed
  Check for outliers - check if it makes sense to keep them
